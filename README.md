# CapitalOneMindSumo

This webapp will be created for the Capital One software summit.   I am under time constraints this week due to classes, homework, internship applications, research, other software challenges, and a video lecture series  I have been asked to produce.  As such, I can only spend 4 hours on this  today.  To make a product quickly, I will recycle some code I wrote at hackathons  and use APIs for the web scraping and keyword extraction.  Note that this product will not be representative of the typical quality of work I  usually produce.  The webapp will use virtualenv and judges will have to run it on local host.

The tentative plan:
    First, I will get a webapp running on localhost using Flask
    Then, I will use alchemy api to extract meaningful text from the webpages and grab relavent keywords/concepts
    I will run my summarization algorithm to reduce the text to the requiste number of words
    I will use alchemy to get other websites with relevant keywords and concepts
    I will print these links below the summary
