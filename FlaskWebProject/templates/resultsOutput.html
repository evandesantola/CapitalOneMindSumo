<h4> Article Summary: </h4> </center>
The new high-efficiency Light-Emitting Diode (LED) fixtures will have a much longer lifespan than the old lights   they won t need to be replaced for 10 years   and can be controlled remotely, which will also reduces energy and labor costs, says Rich Miller, director of the Office of Environmental Policy (OEP).The University s Board of Trustees recently approved a $546,000 upgrade of Gampel s lighting and lighting control system as part of UConn s efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, a goal set forth by the American College and University Presidents  Climate Commitment Commitment and UConn s Climate Action Plan.The project is estimated to cut the arena s energy use by 75 percent and shrink operating and maintenance costs for the lights there by 80 percent, according to a memo from Chief Financial Officer John Biancamano and Provost Mun Choi to the UConn Board of Trustees.In addition to relamping   or replacing current lighting, UConn is in the midst of a four-year retrocommissioning project, which entails modifying existing HVAC systems, equipment, and controls to ensure they are running optimally and efficiently.  When there are 10,000 people here for a basketball game and they see state-of-the-art lighting, we can communicate to a larger audience about the energy savings and the environmental benefits of it.The new lighting system will allow for more adjustments to the level of lighting than was previously possible, helping to reduce costs and energy use.The Gampel project will be funded through the UConn Renewable Energy Credit Fund, with up to 40 percent eligible for rebates from Connecticut Light and Power, according to the memo from Biancamano and Choi.</div>
